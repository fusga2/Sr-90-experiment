# Sr-90 Experiment (Standalone HTML)

This version runs without build tools or npm. Just open `index.html` in a modern browser to see the Sr-90 simulation with the canvas animation, detector controls, and dose-rate display.

## How to Run

1. Download or clone the repository.
2. Open `index.html` directly in your browser (double-click or drag it onto a tab). No additional setup is needed.

If you want to tweak the simulation logic or styling, edit `simulator.js` or `index.html` and refresh the page.
